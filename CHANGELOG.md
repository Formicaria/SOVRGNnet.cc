# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-15 (alpha)

First working release: a self-hosted, Discord-style platform with real
text messaging over Matrix.

### Platform
- First-party email/password auth: scrypt password hashing, httpOnly JWT
  session cookies, login rate limiting. No third-party auth dependency.
- Matrix bridge: one homeserver account provisioned per user, tokens held
  server-side; servers are Spaces, channels are rooms, every message is a
  Matrix event on your own Conduit instance.
- Three-pane chat UI: server rail, channel list, live message pane with
  create/join/discover flows.
- Membership enforcement on every read and write; owner-only channel
  creation; public server discovery and join.
- PostgreSQL via Drizzle with a clean migration history.

### Infrastructure
- Single Docker Compose stack: app, Postgres 16, Conduit, IPFS (Kubo),
  nginx, optional cloudflared tunnel.
- Deployment architecture for sovrgnnet.cc: Cloudflare Pages landing site
  (with Matrix well-known delegation) + Cloudflare Tunnel to the homelab.
- GitHub Actions CI (typecheck, migrate, test against Postgres, build) and
  release image publishing to GHCR on tag.
- Static landing site in `site/`, zero-build, Pages-ready.

### Removed
- Manus scaffold residue, Supabase auth, MySQL compose configs, dead
  dependencies (js-ipfs, webtorrent, aws-sdk), network-dependent tests.

### Known limitations (route to roadmap)
- No E2EE yet — messages are plaintext on your own homeserver (Phase 6).
- Message updates poll every 3s; a push sync bridge is planned.
- No file sharing UI yet (Phase 3), no voice (Phase 6), no password reset.
